# Fast, syncrounized time series visualization tool

ChronoViz is a high-performance Python tool for rendering time series data alongside video syncrounously.

Currently it focuses on fast offline rendering using Matplotlib + FFmpeg, making it easy to generate synchronized visualizations for long recordings.

Roadmap: 
- [ ] CLI tool for easy rendering from command line
- [ ] GPU acceleration using libraries like VisPy or pygfx
- [ ] Realtime streaming support for live data visualization
- [ ] Interactive playback using libraries like PyQt or Dash
